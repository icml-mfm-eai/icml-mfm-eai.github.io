In this challenge, MLLMs are required to predict the next feasible action given a real-time task progress video, current visual observation, and an open-form language instruction as inputs. Sourced from egocentric videos of everyday household activities, the EgoPlan Challenge features realistic tasks, diverse actions, and complex real-world visual observations. ',

        job: `The Composable Generalization Challenge focuses on exploring the capabilities of visual language models (VLMs) for high-level planning in embodied tasks that involve robotic manipulation. Through endowing the embodied agents with the ability to break down novel physical skills like “wipe”, “throw” and “receive” into constituent primitive skills, mitigating the unpredictability and intricacy when expanding the abilities of agents to novel physical skills. The challenge includes a variety of complex tasks, and each demonstration episode is clipped by the  meticulously-designed primitive skills.`,

In this challenge, World Simulators are required to generate a video of an embodied scene based on the given open-form language instructions and the available history image observation frames. The task scenarios come from different embodied tasks such as robotic arms, automatic driving, etc. The generated video will be thoroughly evaluated through special embodied intelligence metrics, including physical rules and motion trajectories, to verify the embodied capabilities of the video.',
